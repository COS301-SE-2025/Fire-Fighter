## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"AI service not configured"**: Check `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. **SSL Certificate errors**: Use HTTP endpoint or accept certificate
3. **User not found**: Ensure user exists in database with correct Firebase UID
4. **Empty responses**: Check console logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Endpoints
- **Health**: `/api/chatbot/health`
- **Capabilities**: `/api/chatbot/capabilities/{userId}`
- **Application Health**: `/actuator/health` (if actuator enabled)
