# Model Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the domain model entities under `com.apex.firefighter.model`.

## Scope

- AccessLogTest: Validates constructors, getters/setters, and null/edge cases for `AccessLog`.
- AccessRequestTest: Covers status transitions (approve/deny/revoke), timestamps, and `toString` formatting.
- AccessSessionTest: Ensures session token generation/format, state transitions, and basic field behavior.
- TicketTest: Verifies default/parameterized construction, mutability of fields, and edge cases.
- UserPreferencesTest: Checks default preferences, override behavior, and timestamps.
- UserRoleTest: Validates assignment metadata and `toString` rendering.
- UserTest: Covers role checks, authorization/admin flags, timestamp updates, and null handling.

## Design Notes

- IDs are auto-generated by JPA; tests assume new entities have `null` IDs. Tests do not set IDs via setters unless the model exposes them (e.g., `AccessRequest#setId`).
- Tests avoid Spring context; they are pure unit tests against POJOs.
- Null-handling is explicitly tested where the model allows nullable fields.

## Running Only Model Tests

Use Maven to run only these tests:

```bash
mvn -q -Dtest="com.apex.firefighter.unit.models.*Test" test
```

## Conventions

- Test names use the pattern: `methodOrScenario_ShouldExpectedBehavior`.
- Tests are independent and do not require database or Spring initialization.

## Adding New Model Tests

1. Create a new `*Test.java` under this directory.
2. Use the package `com.apex.firefighter.unit.models`.
3. Import model classes from `com.apex.firefighter.model`.
4. Prefer AssertJ assertions.
